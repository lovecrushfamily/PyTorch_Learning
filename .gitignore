# Specificity: /data/ only ignores the data folder at the root. If you want to ignore any data folder at any level in your project, use data/ (no leading /).
# Existing Files: The .gitignore file only affects untracked files. If files in /data were previously committed, the git rm -r --cached step is crucial.
